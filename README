# Seed MVC HAPI project

# Installation Steps

# Database

We will use SQL Lite as database. 

SQLite is a lightweight database implementation that allows us to store all our data on a file (configured to be saved on the root folder of the application and to be ignored by git).

It doesn't need any aditional steps besides the initial `npm install` to work and we can query the database using SQL: `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, etc...

## Migration commands

* Running: `npx sequelize-cli db:migrate`
* Creating `nx sequelize-cli migration:create --name create-users-table`
